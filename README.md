# Encrypt_It
### This is a program built with java that allows users to encryt or decrypt a text.Depending on the user's text and key input 

### AUTHOR 
### SHYLA BERNICE ###

### WAY AROUND IT

 Once the java program has run the user has 3 options :encrypt, decrypt, or exit.This is then followed by a prompt to enter the text and a prompt for the key. The user then gets the result back.

###  NOTE

Strings are the only data types to be encrypted and decrypted ....The Key should be an integer between 1-25             


## BDD
| INPUT                                                                       | OUTPUT             |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| Encrypt option followed by the text you want to encrypt and the key to be used  | The encrypted text |
| Decrypt option  followed by the text you want to decrypt and the key to be used  | The decrypted text |
