### WAY AROUND IT

 Once the java program has run the user has 3 options :encrypt, decrypt, or exit.This is then followed by a prompt to enter the text and a prompt for the key. The user then gets the result back.

###  NOTE

Strings are the only data types to be encrypted and decrypted ....The Key should be an integer between 1-16              


## BDD
| INPUT                                                                       | OUTPUT             |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
